## Preface {.unnumbered}

This book presents a comprehensive and structured introduction to systematic reviews as a methodological framework for evidence synthesis. Systematic reviews provide a rigorous and reproducible means of identifying, appraising, and synthesizing research findings, enabling reliable conclusions that inform clinical practice, public health policy, and future research. In an era of expanding scientific literature, systematic reviews offer a structured approach to distilling credible evidence and minimizing bias.

Covering the full continuum of the review process—from formulating research questions and developing protocols to searching, selecting, appraising, extracting, synthesizing, and reporting evidence—it serves as both an instructional guide and a reference text.

Organized to guide readers through each stage of the review process, the book integrates conceptual foundations with detailed methodological guidance. Contributors bring extensive expertise, ensuring both rigor and practical relevance. While establishing best practices, the text acknowledges the evolving nature of systematic reviewing and the need for adaptability, transparency, and critical reflection.

All the best,
