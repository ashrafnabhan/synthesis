# Summary

This volume offers a comprehensive examination of systematic reviews as a methodological framework for evidence synthesis. It provides a structured account of the rationale, principles, and procedures underlying systematic reviewing, with emphasis on methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.

The book addresses the full continuum of the review process: formulation of research questions, development of protocols, systematic searching, study selection, critical appraisal, data extraction, synthesis of evidence (qualitative and quantitative), and standards for reporting. Consideration is also given to methodological challenges, risk of bias, and the application of established guidelines such as PRISMA.

In addition to foundational methods, the volume discusses emerging approaches, including automation, living systematic reviews, and rapid review techniques, reflecting the evolving landscape of evidence synthesis. Ethical and epistemological issues, as well as the implications of systematic reviews for clinical practice, health policy, and research agendas, are also explored.

Intended for students, researchers, and practitioners, this book functions both as an instructional resource and as a reference text. Its aim is to strengthen the capacity to conduct and critically appraise systematic reviews, thereby contributing to the advancement of evidence-based practice and the integrity of research synthesis.
