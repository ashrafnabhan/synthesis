Several reasons can justify the need to conduct a new systematic review. Calls for evidence synthesis are usually on topics where a gap in knowledge has been identified, prioritized and a question posed. Alternatively, the idea for a review may be investigator led, with a topic identified from an area of practice or research interest. Whatever the motivation for undertaking a review the deisgn and conduct should be rigorous.

Systematic reviews can play a valuable role not just in summarizing the findings of published studies but also in drawing attention to the poor and inconsistent methods used. Good systematic reviews are needed to highlight the weaknesses of the evidence base behind diagnostics and interventions and to provide guidance on how better-quality studies can be carried out in the future.

**Is a review required?**

Before undertaking a systematic review, it is necessary to check whether there are already existing or ongoing reviews, and whether a new review is justified. This process should begin by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), MEDLINE, and Embase to identify published reviews. If an existing review is identified which addresses the question of interest, then the review should be assessed to determine whether it is of sufficient quality to guide policy and practice.

If a high-quality review is located, but is outdated, then an update may be warranted. Current relevance will need to be assessed and is particularly important in fields where the research is rapidly evolving. Where appropriate, collaboration with the original research team may assist in the update process by providing access to the data they used.

If a review is of adequate quality and still relevant, there may be no need to undertake another systematic review.

Where a new systematic review or an update is required, the next step is to establish a review team and possibly an advisory group, to develop the review protocol.

**The review team**

The review team should have a range of skills to conduct the review. Ideally these should include a systematic review methodology expert and subject area expert. The team can include health economics and/or qualitative research methods experts where appropriate. Any conflicts of interest should be explicitly noted early in the process, and steps taken to ensure that these do not impact on the review process.

**The advisory group**

In addition to the team who will undertake the review there may be a number of individuals or groups who are consulted at various stages, including for example health care professionals, patient representatives, service users and experts in research methods. Some funding bodies require the establishment of an advisory group who will comment on the protocol and final report and provide input to ensure that the review has practical relevance to likely end users. Even if this is not the case, and even where the review team is knowledgeable about the area, it is still valuable to have an advisory group whose members can be consulted at key stages.
